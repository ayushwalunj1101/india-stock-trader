  Short-term and swing trading assistant for the Indian stock market (NSE/BSE).
  Helps with stock screening, technical analysis, trade planning, and watchlist generation
  focused on breakout/breakdown patterns, support-resistance levels, and volume-price action.
  Use this skill whenever the user mentions Indian stocks, NSE, BSE, Nifty, swing trades,
  short-term trades, positional trades, breakout setups, stock screening for Indian markets,
  trade plans for Indian equities, or asks for watchlists with entry/exit/SL levels.
  Also trigger when the user uploads Indian market data (CSV exports, screenshots of charts),
  mentions specific NSE/BSE stock names or tickers, or asks questions like
  "find me good setups", "scan for breakouts", "give me a trade plan for TATAMOTORS",
  "what looks good in Nifty 50 right now", or "build me a watchlist".
  Do NOT trigger for intraday/scalping, options strategies, mutual fund analysis,
  long-term investing (6+ months), or non-Indian markets.

# India Stock Trader

A trading assistant for short-term and positional trades on Indian equities (NSE/BSE). Covers two timeframes — **2-5 day swings** and **1-4 week positional** — depending on the setup.

## Core Philosophy

This skill is built around three pillars of price-volume technical analysis:

1. **Breakout / Breakdown patterns** — Stocks breaking out of consolidation ranges, trendlines, or chart patterns (flags, triangles, rectangles) on above-average volume are primary candidates.
2. **Support-Resistance levels** — Key horizontal levels where price has historically reversed or stalled. These define entry zones, stop-losses, and targets.
3. **Volume-Price action** — Volume confirms conviction. A breakout without volume is suspect. A pullback on declining volume to support is healthy. **Delivery percentage** adds a layer of quality to volume analysis — in Indian markets, high volume with low delivery % (below 30%) often means intraday speculation rather than genuine accumulation. For swing/positional trades, look for delivery % above 35-40% on breakout days.

The skill keeps it simple: no derivative overlays (F&O, OI, PCR), no macro indicators (FII/DII flows), no oscillator soup. Just price, volume, delivery, and structure.

---

## Two Modes of Operation

Detect which mode the user needs from context cues:

### Mode 1: Quick Screen

**Triggers**: User wants candidates or a watchlist. Phrases like "scan for", "find me", "what looks good", "screen stocks", "build a watchlist", "any breakout setups".

**Workflow**:
1. Determine the universe — Nifty 50, Nifty 200, a specific sector, or user-specified list
2. Use web search to pull recent price action and market context (broad scan)
3. Screen for setups matching the criteria below — shortlist 4-6 candidates
4. **Verify CMP for each shortlisted stock** with individual searches before calculating any levels
5. Output a **watchlist** with ticker, setup type, key levels (support/resistance/breakout level), and a one-line rationale

**Output format**: A clean markdown table or spreadsheet (if the user wants a file). Columns:

| Stock | Setup Type | CMP | Entry Zone | SL | Target 1 | Target 2 | R:R | Delivery % | Score | Timeframe | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----|------------|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|

If the user requests a spreadsheet, generate an `.xlsx` file using the xlsx skill.

### Mode 2: Full Trade Plan

**Triggers**: User names a specific stock, or says "analyze", "trade plan", "full analysis", "should I buy/sell X", "deep dive on X".

**Output Detail Toggle**: Detect from context whether the user wants brief or detailed output.
- **Brief mode** — triggers: "quick take", "brief", "short", "just the levels", "tldr", or when the user asks about multiple stocks in one message. Output: Verdict + Key Levels + Conviction Score + Safety Checks + GTT Format. Skip the narrative sections.
- **Detailed mode** — triggers: "full analysis", "deep dive", "detailed", or when user asks about a single stock with no brevity cue. Output: All 12 sections of the trade plan template.
- **Default**: Detailed for single-stock analysis, Brief for multi-stock queries. When unsure, go detailed — the user can always say "shorter" and you switch.

**Brief output format:**
```
# TATAPOWER — Quick Take (21 March 2026)

**CMP**: ₹404.15 | **Score**: 7.5/10 (B-grade)
**Setup**: Breakout above ₹402 (inverse H&S neckline) on 3.8x volume

**Levels**: Entry ₹400-408 | SL ₹385 | T1 ₹417 | T2 ₹435
**R:R**: 1:0.7 (T1) / 1:1.6 (T2) | Slippage-adjusted: ~1:1.4 (T2)
**Sizing** (₹3L, 2% risk): 315 shares @ ₹404

**Safety**: ✅ No ASM/GSM | ✅ No F&O ban | ⚠️ VIX 18.5 (elevated) | Earnings May 2026
**Smart money**: No major bulk deals last 30 days

**Verdict**: Actionable. Breakout triggered with volume. Buy ₹400-408, SL ₹385.

## Zerodha GTT
BUY trigger ₹402 / limit ₹405 / qty 315
SL trigger ₹385 / limit ₹383 / qty 315
```

**Workflow**:
1. Gather data on the stock — current price, recent price history, volume trends, key levels
2. Identify the current price structure (trending, range-bound, breakout, pullback)
3. Map out support and resistance levels
4. Assess volume behavior relative to price moves
5. Determine if there's a actionable setup, and if so, define the trade plan
6. Calculate position sizing based on SL distance

**Output format**: A structured trade report (markdown in chat, or `.md`/`.docx` file if requested):

```

- **SL distance**: ₹XXX (X.X%)
- **Position size**: For ₹[CAPITAL], buy [QTY] shares (₹[AMOUNT] deployed)

## What Could Go Wrong
[Key risks — sector weakness, earnings nearby, broader market trend against the trade, gap risk with stock beta noted, slippage estimate for entry and SL]

## Safety Checks
- ASM/GSM status: [Clear / Under surveillance]
- F&O ban: [No / Yes — flag]
- Circuit limit: [±X%]

## Risk Calendar
[List upcoming events within the trade's expected holding period — earnings dates, RBI policy, F&O expiry, geopolitical risks]

## Verdict
[Clear actionable summary — "Actionable above ₹XXX with SL at ₹XXX" or "No setup yet, add to watchlist and monitor"]

## Screening Criteria

When scanning for candidates, look for these setups in order of priority:

### High-Priority Setups
- **Volume breakout**: Stock closing above a resistance level or consolidation range with volume significantly above its 20-day average (1.5x+ is a good threshold) AND delivery percentage above 35%. High volume with low delivery (<30%) means intraday churn, not real accumulation — treat such breakouts with suspicion.
- **Pullback to breakout zone**: Stock that recently broke out, pulled back to the breakout level on declining volume, and is holding. The former resistance becomes support.
- **Base breakout**: Stock emerging from a multi-week consolidation (tight range, declining volume) with a volume spike and healthy delivery %

### Medium-Priority Setups
- **Support bounce**: Stock testing a well-established support level (tested 2+ times) with volume drying up on the decline, suggesting sellers are exhausted
- **Higher-low formation**: Stock making a series of higher lows, approaching resistance — potential breakout candidate

### Setups to Avoid
- Stocks in a clear downtrend (lower highs, lower lows) without any base formation
- Breakouts on low or declining volume
- Breakouts with high volume but very low delivery % (<25%) — likely speculative/intraday driven, not sustained buying
- Stocks near earnings dates (within 1 week) unless the user explicitly wants to trade the event
- Illiquid stocks (very low average volumes) — harder to exit
- Stocks under ASM/GSM surveillance — restricted trading, reduced circuits, likely operator manipulation
- Stocks in F&O ban period — erratic price action from unwinding positions
- Stocks showing operator activity red flags (sudden unexplained spikes, micro-cap, no institutional holding, <15% delivery on huge volume)

### Delivery Percentage Guidelines
Delivery % tells you what fraction of traded volume resulted in actual change of ownership (shares delivered to demat accounts) vs intraday round-trips. For swing/positional trades:
- **Above 40%**: Strong conviction — genuine accumulation or distribution
- **35-40%**: Acceptable — decent institutional interest
- **25-35%**: Caution — mixed signal, higher speculative component
- **Below 25%**: Red flag — mostly intraday speculation, breakout may not sustain

When searching for delivery data, try "[STOCK] delivery percentage today NSE" or check NSE bhavcopy data. If delivery % data isn't available for a specific stock, note it as "delivery data unavailable" rather than skipping the check — let the trader know there's a gap.

---

## Data Gathering Strategy

The skill works with whatever data is available. Don't demand all sources — use what you can get.

### CRITICAL: Price Verification Rule

**Never estimate or guess a stock's CMP.** Every stock that appears in a watchlist or trade plan must have its current price verified through a dedicated search. Market summary articles that mention "TATASTEEL +3.08%" tell you the percentage move but NOT the actual price — and inferring the price from memory or context leads to dangerous errors (e.g., quoting TRENT at ₹5,200 when it's actually at ₹3,500).

The rule is simple: **before publishing any entry/SL/target levels for a stock, search for "[STOCK] share price today" to confirm the CMP.** If you're building a watchlist with 5 stocks, that's 5 individual price verification searches. This is non-negotiable — a watchlist with wrong CMPs is worse than no watchlist at all, because a trader may act on it.

For screening workflows, do it in two passes:
1. **Pass 1 (broad scan)**: Search for market movers, breakout candidates, sector performance to identify a shortlist of 4-6 names
2. **Pass 2 (price verification)**: For each shortlisted stock, search for its actual current price, 52W high/low, and key levels before including it in the output

### Kite MCP (best source when available)
If the user has Kite MCP connected, it becomes the primary data source:
- `get_ltp` / `get_quote` for real-time prices — faster and more accurate than web search
- `get_holdings` for existing portfolio context
- `get_margins` for available capital
- This eliminates the need for web search price verification — Kite data is live and authoritative

### Web Search (primary when Kite MCP is not available)
- Search for "[STOCK] share price today", "[STOCK] technical analysis", "[STOCK] chart" to get current levels
- Search for "NSE top gainers today", "stocks near 52 week high NSE", "breakout stocks India today" for screening
- Search for sector-specific moves: "IT stocks NSE today", "pharma stocks breakout"

### User-Provided Data
- If the user uploads a **CSV** from their broker/screener — parse it and work with the data directly
- If the user shares a **chart screenshot** — read the visible levels, patterns, and indicators from the image
- If the user provides a **list of stocks** — analyze each one

### Conversational Context
- If the user just mentions a stock name ("what about RELIANCE?"), search for current data and analyze
- If the user gives you levels ("HDFCBANK support at 1580, resistance at 1650"), work with those directly without searching

---

## Risk Management Defaults

These are sensible defaults. The user can override any of them.

- **Risk per trade**: 1-2% of trading capital. If the user hasn't specified their capital, ask once, then remember for the session. If they don't want to share, skip position sizing and just give levels.
- **Minimum Risk:Reward**: 1:2. Don't recommend trades where the SL distance is larger than the potential gain. If R:R is between 1:1.5 and 1:2, mention it as a "marginal R:R" setup.
- **Stop Loss placement**: Always based on price structure, not arbitrary percentages. SL goes below the nearest support (for longs) or above nearest resistance (for shorts). If the SL distance makes the R:R unfavorable, the trade isn't worth taking — say so.
- **Position sizing formula**: `Shares = (Capital × Risk%) / SL Distance per share`
  - Example: ₹5,00,000 capital, 2% risk = ₹10,000 max loss. If SL is ₹20 away from entry → buy 500 shares.
- **Partial booking**: Suggest booking 50% at Target 1 and trailing SL to entry for the rest. This is a suggestion, not a rule.
- **Position scaling (adding to winners)**: When a trade moves in your favor and the setup strengthens, adding to the position can turn a good trade into a portfolio-maker. See `references/alpha-and-edge.md` for the full scaling framework — rules on when to add, how much, and how to adjust SL for the combined position.
- **Maximum portfolio heat**: Total risk across all open positions must not exceed 6-8% of capital. In high VIX (>20), reduce to 4-5%. When suggesting a new trade, check if adding it would breach this limit. See `references/alpha-and-edge.md` for details.
- **India VIX check**: Always check India VIX before building any watchlist or trade plan. VIX below 15 = normal trading. VIX 15-20 = widen SLs 10-15%, reduce sizes. VIX above 20 = only A-grade setups, half-size positions. VIX above 25 = mostly cash. See `references/alpha-and-edge.md` for full VIX framework.
- **Slippage buffer**: Factor ₹3-5 slippage for large-caps, ₹5-15 for mid-caps into entry price and SL calculations. Breakout entries typically have higher slippage. Note adjusted R:R after slippage. See `references/alpha-and-edge.md`.
- **Gap risk awareness**: Note stock beta in trade plans. High-beta stocks (>1.3) amplify market gaps. Friday entries carry extra weekend gap risk. Before long weekends, suggest booking partial profits or tightening SLs. See `references/alpha-and-edge.md`.

## Important Disclaimers

Every trade report and watchlist must end with a brief disclaimer:

> *This is a technical analysis-based trade idea, not financial advice. Always do your own research and manage your risk. Past patterns don't guarantee future results.*

Keep it short — one or two lines max. Don't make it a wall of legal text.

---

## Style Notes

- Use ₹ (rupee symbol) for all prices
- Use Indian number formatting where possible (e.g., ₹1,50,000 not ₹150,000)
- Refer to stocks by their NSE ticker (RELIANCE, TATAMOTORS, HDFCBANK, etc.)
- Be direct and opinionated — traders want clear "yes/no/wait" signals, not wishy-washy "it could go either way" analysis. If the setup isn't clean, say so.
- When a trade idea has merit, lead with the setup and levels. When it doesn't, say "no setup" and explain briefly why.
- Timeframe callout is important — explicitly state whether this is a swing (2-5 day) or positional (1-4 week) idea so the trader sets expectations correctly.

---

## Conviction Scoring System

Every trade setup gets an objective score out of 10 based on 8 weighted parameters: volume, delivery %, price vs MAs, sector momentum, R:R ratio, relative strength, weekly-daily alignment, and earnings proximity.

**Score interpretation:**
- **8-10 (A-grade)**: Full position. All key factors aligned.
- **6-7.5 (B-grade)**: Reduced position (50-75%). Most factors support.
- **4-5.5 (C-grade)**: Small pilot only (25-50%). Speculative.
- **Below 4**: No trade. Skip or watchlist.

The score also adjusts position sizing — A-grade setups get 2% risk, B-grade gets 1-1.5%, C-grade gets max 0.5-1%.

**For the full scoring rubric and presentation format**, read `references/conviction-scoring.md`.

---

## Advanced Technical Filters

Apply these on top of the core price-volume-structure analysis. In Quick Screen mode, use them to filter and rank candidates. In Full Trade Plan mode, include them as sections in the report.

1. **Relative Strength Ranking** — How is the stock performing vs Nifty and its sector? Stocks with strong RS (outperforming Nifty by 5%+) are higher priority.
2. **Multiple Timeframe Check** — Is the weekly trend aligned with the daily setup? Weekly bullish + daily breakout = highest probability. Weekly bearish + daily bounce = risky counter-trend trade.
3. **Gap Analysis** — Breakaway gaps on volume are actionable. Exhaustion gaps after long runs are warning signs. Gaps that fill intraday are weak.
4. **Earnings Calendar Alert** — Flag if earnings are within 14 days. Within 7 days = prominent warning. This is a binary risk event that can override any technical setup.

**For detailed logic and frameworks**, read `references/advanced-filters.md`.

---

## Sector Rotation Radar

When scanning for trades, always check which sectors are leading and lagging. A great stock in a weak sector will underperform a mediocre stock in a strong sector.

**Quick check:** Search "Nifty sectoral indices performance today" to get the sector heatmap. Identify leading sectors (outperforming Nifty by 2%+ over 1 month) and lagging sectors.

**In watchlists**, prioritize candidates from leading sectors. In trade plans, add a one-liner: "Sector: Nifty Metal (+3.5% this week, outperforming Nifty). Sector momentum supports this trade."

**Detailed sector rotation framework** is in `references/advanced-filters.md` under "Sector Rotation Radar".

---

## Watchlist Maintenance Mode

**Triggers**: User says "update my watchlist", "check my picks", "are my setups still valid", or provides a list of stocks they're tracking.

For each stock: verify current price → check if SL hit / target hit / setup still valid / setup invalidated → output updated watchlist with status flags (🟢 Active, 🟡 Pending, 🔴 Stopped out, ✅ Target hit, ❌ Invalidated).

**Full format and examples** in `references/workflow-tools.md`.

---

## News & Event Risk Flagging

Proactively flag risk events when building any trade plan or watchlist. Key events: earnings dates, RBI policy, F&O expiry weeks, geopolitical events, index rebalancing, and global macro (US Fed, etc.).

Add a "Risk Calendar" section to trade plans listing events within the expected holding period. In watchlists, add ⚠️ flags next to affected stocks.

**Detailed event list and flagging format** in `references/workflow-tools.md`.

---

## Risk Dashboard

When the user has multiple active positions, provide a portfolio-level view on request. Shows all positions with P&L, remaining risk, sector concentration, and correlation warnings.

**Triggers**: "how's my portfolio", "check my positions", "risk check", or when the user provides a list of active trades.

**Full dashboard format** in `references/workflow-tools.md`.

---

## Order Execution Format

**With Kite MCP (self-hosted)**: Place orders directly via `place_order` tool after explicit user confirmation. Always use CNC product type for swing/positional trades. See `references/kite-mcp.md` for the full execution flow and safety rules.

**Without Kite MCP (or hosted read-only)**: Format the trade plan with a ready-to-copy **Zerodha GTT order block** so the user can quickly place orders manually. Include trigger price, limit price, quantity, and SL trigger. Adapt format if user mentions another broker (Groww, Angel One, etc.).

**GTT format template** in `references/workflow-tools.md`.

---

## Position Sizing Calculator

When the user provides capital, don't just show the formula — present a complete breakdown table with entry, SL, SL distance, max shares at different risk levels, capital deployed, and capital remaining. Adjust risk % based on conviction score (A-grade = 2%, B-grade = 1.5%, C-grade = 1%).

If the user hasn't shared capital, ask once and remember for the session.

**Full calculator format** in `references/workflow-tools.md`.

---

## Indian Market Mechanics

Before recommending any stock — especially outside Nifty 50 — run these safety checks:

1. **Circuit limits**: Check the stock's price band (2%/5%/10%/20%). If SL is close to the circuit limit, flag gap risk — your SL may not execute if the stock hits lower circuit.
2. **ASM/GSM status**: Search "[STOCK] ASM GSM status". If under surveillance → do not recommend. Flag as "restricted trading, likely operator activity."
3. **F&O ban**: Search "F&O ban list today NSE". Stocks in ban have erratic price action → flag and suggest waiting.
4. **Operator activity check**: For mid/small caps, look for red flags — sudden unexplained spikes, micro-cap, <15% delivery on huge volume, no institutional holding. If 3+ red flags → avoid.
5. **T+1 settlement**: Note that delivery trades settle T+1. Friday entries carry weekend gap risk. Before long weekends/holidays, add a warning.

**For detailed rules on all Indian market mechanics**, read `references/india-mechanics.md`. This covers circuit limits, T+1 settlement, ASM/GSM framework, F&O ban periods, operator activity warnings, and budget/RBI policy trading patterns.

---

## Alpha & Edge Features

These go beyond standard technical analysis to provide an informational advantage.

1. **Unusual volume detection**: Don't just check "above average" — flag statistically anomalous volume (3x+ average). Cross-reference with delivery % using the interpretation matrix in the reference file. Anomalous volume + high delivery = institutional activity signal.
2. **Bulk/block deal tracking**: Always search for recent bulk/block deals (last 30 days) when analyzing a stock. Institutional buying in bulk + technical setup = conviction boost. Promoter selling = caution flag.
3. **Sector-stock divergence**: When a stock diverges from its sector by >3%, flag it. Laggard in a strong sector = potential catch-up play. Leader in a weak sector = genuine relative strength.
4. **Historical pattern context**: Reference known Indian market pattern tendencies — e.g., breakouts from 3+ week bases in Nifty 50 stocks have ~70% success rate in trending markets, ~50% when Nifty is below 200 DMA. Calibrate expectations.
5. **India VIX integration**: Check VIX before every analysis session. VIX level directly adjusts position sizing and conviction thresholds.
6. **Portfolio heat monitoring**: Track total risk across all open positions. Never exceed 6-8% of capital. In high-VIX environments, cap at 4-5%.

**For full frameworks, interpretation matrices, and implementation details**, read `references/alpha-and-edge.md`.

---

## Recommendation Tracking

The skill should track its own past recommendations to build a feedback loop. Over time, this helps the trader (and the skill) understand what's working and what isn't.

**How it works:**
When the user asks to track performance — "how did your picks do?", "track my trades", "recommendation scorecard" — search for current prices of previously recommended stocks and generate a performance report.

**What to track for each recommendation:**
- Stock, date recommended, entry zone, SL, T1, T2, conviction score
- Current status: 🟢 Hit T1, ✅ Hit T2, 🔴 Hit SL, 🟡 Still active, ❌ Setup invalidated before entry
- P&L if entered at the midpoint of the entry zone
- Days held (or days since recommendation)

**Performance summary format:**
```
## Recommendation Scorecard — Last 30 Days

Total recommendations: 12
Triggered (entered): 9 | Not triggered: 3

| Outcome | Count | Rate |
|---------|-------|------|
| Hit T1+ | 5 | 55.6% |
| Hit T2 | 3 | 33.3% |
| Stopped out | 3 | 33.3% |
| Still active | 1 | 11.1% |

Avg win: +6.2% | Avg loss: -3.8% | Win/loss ratio: 1.63x
A-grade setups: 4/4 hit T1 (100%) | B-grade: 1/3 hit T1 (33%) | C-grade: 0/2 (0%)

Key insight: A-grade setups are outperforming significantly.
Adjust strategy: Consider skipping C-grade setups entirely.
```

**How to maintain this data:**
- The skill doesn't persist data between sessions, so the user needs to maintain a simple tracking sheet (or the skill can generate/update an xlsx file)
- When generating a new trade plan, offer: "Want me to add this to your tracking sheet?"
- When the user provides their tracking data (CSV, list of trades, or asks to check old picks), generate the scorecard

**For the tracking spreadsheet template**, generate an xlsx with columns: Date, Stock, Entry Zone, Actual Entry, SL, T1, T2, Score, Status, Exit Price, P&L %, Days Held, Notes. See `references/workflow-tools.md` for format details.

---

## Kite MCP Integration (Zerodha)

If the user has Zerodha's Kite MCP connected, the skill gets significantly more powerful. Kite MCP provides direct access to the user's trading account — live prices, holdings, positions, margins, and (with self-hosted setup) order placement.

**Detect and use Kite MCP tools when available:**
- Use `get_ltp` / `get_quote` for real-time verified prices instead of web search
- Use `get_holdings` + `get_positions` for live risk dashboard data
- Use `get_margins` to check available capital for position sizing
- Use `place_order` (self-hosted only) to execute trades after explicit user confirmation
- Cross-reference holdings when suggesting new trades — flag sector concentration

**If Kite MCP is NOT connected**, the skill works fully via web search + copy-paste order formats. Suggest to the user: "Connect Kite MCP for live portfolio data and real-time prices — it's free. See https://zerodha.com/products/mcp/"

**For detailed integration logic, order execution flow, and setup instructions**, read `references/kite-mcp.md`.
